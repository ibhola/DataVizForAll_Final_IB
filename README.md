Using the DataVizforAll enrollment data <cite> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1egX_akJccnCSzdk1aaDdtrEGe5HcaTrlOW-Yf6mJ3Uo/edit#gid=70869349" target="_blank"> provided by the Lecturers</a> </cite>suggested the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What occupation were the students?</li>
<li>What were the education levels of the students?</li>
</ul>
<p/>
The source data was grouped and summarized <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xjRvft0Mt2Xb4r4Vy1wCGKezJ1LeDjmQspXxHduM-pg/pubhtml" target="_blank">here.</a><br/>
The result from the data:
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xjRvft0Mt2Xb4r4Vy1wCGKezJ1LeDjmQspXxHduM-pg/pubchart?oid=1060235457&format=interactive" width="85%" height="350"></iframe>

The resulting data chart, above, shows that
<ul>
<li> The majority of the students were in Information Technology followed by <br/>Students most likely in college/university</li>
<li> The majority had more years of education than just college</li>
</ul>
Though the predominance of IT experienced students were not surprising, the cross-section of employment was, for instance journalism
The visual, even when the goals of the students are not directly considered, would indicate that since most student have more than high-school education and that the purpose of doing the course is either for curiousity, educational enhancement or some form of personal development.

<b>Personal reflection</b>
</p>
The learning in the course was unexpected and can be used immediately by me in my work.
I had expected that there would have been different grahical representations of data than the the usual line and bar charts. For instance the graphical representation of money raised for crowd funding in the form of a guage. Or the traffic lights of red, amber, green when data was within a certain threshholds. <br/>
Thought those items were not specifically covered, the use of data in the form of maps was something I had not seen before and I thought they were quite useful and very effective. The use of free tools and template were useful and educational. It is that aspect of the course that I can see immediate value in my work.
<p>
I would like to give a heart-felt thanks to the lecturers for format and details of the lectures and readings. The lecturers were very responsive and provided clarity in all the material. The sessions were not unduly heavy and provided a progressive learning experience. Thanks!</p>
